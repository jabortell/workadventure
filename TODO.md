# TODO

## Basic

- [ ] I'm not able to run the application as described in the [README](README.md). From some issues posted on the Github page, there appears to be a general confusion about how to start the application in its development environment.
- [ ] In general, I'm gonna have to get a basic understanding of `Docker` and `Docker Compose`.

## Just Would Be So Cool

- [ ] NPCs
- [ ] Easter eggs
- [ ] Hidden rooms

## Office NPCs

- [ ] Rolling office chair everywhere NPC
- [ ] NPC chasing other NPC for meeting
- [ ] Melancholic rooftop philosopher NPC
- [ ] Or maybe entering the rooftop, you interrupt a battle between Sora and an Organization XIII member, who disappears through a void. "Who was that??" your characters asks. "That was Nobody". The next time that you enter the rooftop, Sora is sitting on the ledge, looking out to the sunset, and a sad song reminiscent of Dearly Beloved plays. Or maybe Sora isn't there, but the song plays. And there's the sunset. And a drippy pool of salty sea ice cream.


## The Club

### Experience

- [ ] Design and implement a framework to specify a "show" that combines a choregraphed sequence of music, lights, and NPC animation. For example, when a person enters the Club, a certain set-piece should play, in which all audio and visual elements are synchronized.
- [ ] A light show should allow strobes, flashes, colors, etc.

### Art Design

- [ ] "D1sc0 P^rp|e" in large letters on the club floor, revealed underneath the dancers by the ultraviolet from the strobes.
- [ ] DJ some nights
- [ ] Twin Peaks Road House stage some nights
- [ ] Some nights it's pounding.
- [ ] Some nights it's a chill, slow-dancer.
- [ ] There's a bar. The bar itself is white, lit underneath by LEDs.
- [ ] Maybe top management doesn't get the club when they enter, but an empty warehouse or something?
- [ ] NPCs dancing, head banging, pole dancers, waiters, bar tenders, drugs, pimps, kingpins.

## Technical

- [ ] Interaction with stationary objects, like windows, doors, printers, etc.
- [ ] Interaction with mobile objects, like paper, brooms, mops, cups, thermos, etc.
- [ ] Continuable dialogue boxes
- [ ] Expressive dialogue: pause, ticker, vibration, bold, etc.
